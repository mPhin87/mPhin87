- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mPhin87
With over 20 years of experience in IT services, I provide comprehensive support in internal IT,
focusing on the planning, implementation, and maintenance of server-client systems, networks, as
well as cloud applications and infrastructure, with a particular emphasis on Microsoft 365.

My areas of expertise include 2nd- and 3rd-level support, IT consulting, migration from on-premise 
to cloud services, and solving complex IT issues.

I highly value working at STARFACE GROUP, where teamwork, prioritization, and clear 
communication are emphasized, whether on-site or in a hybrid model. Always open to new 
challenges, I prioritize continuous learning and development.
